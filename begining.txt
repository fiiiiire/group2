You are 17 years old and an orphan.
Your parents were burtually murdered in front of you.
On a eerie rainy day the family was enjoying cup of hot choco when a knock was heard.
Magnus's father went to check who it was.A old man with no arms were standing at the door.
He asked for shelter from the rain.
Being the kindhearted man he was Magnus's father let him in but a tragedy was what awaited the kind family.
The old man transformed into a monster and bite of Magnus's father's head.
His horrified mother pushed magnus out of their home and told him to run and dont look back.
And he run and run while hearing his mother crying out in pain.
The monster killed her too.
After a few days magnus returned to his home only to see the half rotten bodies of his parents.
He was sad but more than that anger overwelhmed him.
He swear to take revenge on that monster.
And so he went to track down the the monster.
He found its foot prints leading to a dungeon deep in forest.
An adventure awaits him
